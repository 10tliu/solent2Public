        <h1>Train Ticket System Demo</h1>
        <p>This demo allows you to simulate a train ticket system.<BR>
        You can run the demo in two modes depending on which link you select below.<BR>
        This simulates whether the user is logged in as an administrator or is simply a customer.<BR>
        As an administrator you can add destinations and timetabled journeys with prices.<BR>
        As a customer, you can only select a journey to a destination and purchase a ticket.<p>
